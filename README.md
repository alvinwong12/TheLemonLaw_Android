The Lemon Law Android Version

The Lemon Law. As stated by Barney Stinson, You only need 5 minutes to know whether or not you'll want to date that person.  Created by : Matthew, Peter and Alvin for EngHacks 2017 - Achieved Top 10  This is a simple chat application that was inspired by Barney Stinson's "Lemon Law" from the show: "How I met your Mother" which states that only 5 minutes is needed to get to know someone well enough to decide if you would want to date him/her.  People who use this application are automatically placed into chat rooms of maximum 2 occupancy. They are then given 5 minutes to talk to each other and decide whether or not they would like to exchange contact information with the other person. After 5 minutes is up, they are both kicked out of the room and can re-enter the application to meet someone new.

You can open multiple tabs and load TheLemonLaw so you can try out the chat platform without using another computer.
